# Phys771
This is a repository for the Phys711 course (*Advanced Topic in Experimental and Theoretical Physics*) in Fall 2022 at UNLV. 

In this class, we expect to cover the following selected topics.

- Elastic theory to investigate both hard and soft materials
- Modern global optimization methods applied to the structure prediction 
- Displacive phase transition

The class will be organized in the `project-oriented` manner. The students will be split into different working groups according to their interests. Each working group will go over the following three phases:

- Start with the assigned literature and then give weekly presentation (weeks 1-4). 
- Upon the feedback from the in-class discussion, each group will continue to explore the in-depth topics and conduct a short research project. The progress of each project needs to be updated on the weekly basis (week 5-10).
- Write a report to summarize the key results.

## Short description of each topic

### Elastic theory to investigate both hard and soft materials
In the topic, we are aimed to overview the fundamental elastic theory and apply it to investigate the crystalline materials. In particular, we need to have deep understanding about different elastic properties (e.g., elastic constants, bulk moduls, Poisoon ratio, .etc) and know how compute (measure) them both in experiment and calculation. Furthermore, we will investigate the elastic reponses on different class of materials (e.g., metal, ceramic and organic materials).

### Modern global optimization methods applied to structure prediction
We will review different global optimization techniques that have been applied to the prediction of materials and proteins. In particular, we will focus on the recent progress in protein structure prediction and go over the necessary technical implementations. Finally, a comparative study between the protein and cluster structure predictions will be conducted.

### Displasive phase transition
We will focus the speical type of phase transition that is driven by small atomic displacements. In the type of transition, there often exists a clear group-subgroup symmetry relation in their crystal structures. In particular, we will focus on its application for designing new ferroelectic and piezoelectric materials.
