# Phys771
This is a repository for the Phys711 course (*Advanced Topic in Experimental and Theoretical Physics*) in Fall 2022 at UNLV. 

In this class, we expect to cover the following selected topics.

- Elastic theory to investigate both hard and soft materials
- Modern global optimization methods applied to the structure prediction 
- Displacive phase transition

The class will be organized in the `project-oriented` manner. The students will be split into different working groups according to their interests. Each working group will go over the following three phases:

- Start with the assigned literature and then give weekly presentation (weeks 1-4). 
- Upon the feedback from the in-class discussion, each group will continue to explore the in-depth topics and conduct a short research project. The progress of each project needs to be updated on the weekly basis (week 5-10).
- Write a report to summarize the key results.

## Short description of each topic

### Elastic theory and its application

In the topic, we are aimed to overview the fundamental elastic theory and apply it to investigate the crystalline materials.

1. The fundamental of elastic theory (elastic constants as a tensor)
2. Elastic properties (bulk modulus, Poisson’s ration, .etc), how to compute/measure them?
3. Analysis of elastic properties 
    * averaging scheme
    * anisotropic analysis
4. Applications to metals, ceramics and organic crystals

### Modern global optimization methods applied to structure prediction

We will review different global optimization techniques that have been applied to the prediction of materials and proteins. In particular, we will focus on 

1. Recent progress in protein structure prediction 
2. Necessary technical implementations used in structure prediction
3. a comparative study between the protein and cluster structure predictions.

### Displacive phase transition
We will focus the special type of phase transition that is driven by small atomic displacements. 

1. Landaus’ theory on 2nd-order phase transition
2. Order parameters for describing different kinds of phase transitions
3. Group-subgroup symmetry relation in their crystal structures.
4. Designing new ferroelectric and piezoelectric materials.
