# Machine Learning Lecture notes
This repo is primarily designed for the introduction of various **machine learning methods** such as 
- neural network
- support vector machine
- decision tree
- random forest

and basic techniques used in data science
- preprocessing
- regularization

and some others.

In principle, we intend to review each method from three aspects
- mathematic principle: fundamental concepts
- pratical application: we will primarily use the modules based on scikit-learn 
- coding session: we will build a light version of code from the scratch to mimic the modules in scikit-learn.
